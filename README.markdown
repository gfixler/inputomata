## Vim FSMs and You

Inputomata.tim provides a general-purpose, event-driven finite-state machine
triggered by user key presses, with states defined in TimL maps.

### What?

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine

Put simply, you define one or more states of a finite-state machine (FSM) in a
[Clojure-like] TimL map, providing each with one or more triggers. Triggers are
single characters that you can press on the keyboard while in the FSM, which
can either transfer you to another state, run a function, or exit the FSM.

### Why is it called "Inputomata"?

Two reasons:

1. Names are [hard](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html).
2. It's a [portmanteau][] of "input" and "[automata][]."

[automata]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory

### How do I pronounce it?

However you like. I say it sort of like "imp pedometer," sans the terminal "r."

### Features

* Implemented in Tim Pope's awesome, Clojure-like TimL language.
* State maps are very easy to define via Clojure-like TimL maps.
* The implementation is super small, because TimL is expressive.
* Allows continuous Vim<->user interaction without any mappings.
* Each of these bullet points has the same number of characters.

### Requirements

[TimL](https://github.com/tpope/timl)

### Vim/VimL/TimL interop

* Your FSMs can interact with Vim/VimL/TimL in the same way that TimL can.
* Input from the user - on a key-by-key basis - can trigger state transfer, or
  can call any arbitrary TimL function (currently without state change).
* Inputomata.tim uses Vim's getchar in a loop, trapping the user until they
  find an exit condition (provided in your states map), or they hit ctrl+c.
* Because the entirety of the interaction takes place in a TimL loop/recur, no
  changes need to be made to Vim, e.g. no mappings are set, or changed.

### Getting started

This plugin is setup in the standard Vim fashion. You may install it manually,
or through Pathogen, Vundle, NeoBundle, etc...

I recommend installing [pathogen.vim][], then copying and pasting this:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/timl.git

[pathogen.vim]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

### Examples

#### The Flyover States

The simplest example is the empty states map. State names are TimL keywords,
and a nil value is a terminating condition. This FSM would start, immediately
exit, and return "done", which would be displayed in the status line. Note that
all states maps must at least have a :start state.

    (use 'inputomata.core)
    (fsm {:start nil})

#### Two States, and a Bridge Betwixt

This FSM allows jumping to :a or :b states on start, then between :a and :b as
often as you like, with the ability to quit out at any point. The messages -
optional per state - let you know where you are at all times.

    (fsm {:start {:msg "Press 'a' or 'b', or 'q' to quit"
                  \a :a
                  \b :b
                  \q nil}
          :a {:msg "State 'a'. Press 'b' ('q' to quit)"
              \b :b
              \q nil}
          :b {:msg "State 'b'. Press 'a' ('q' to quit)"
              \a :a
              \q nil}})

#### I Put Some State in Your States...

You can work with state in the same scope as your FSM. A nice way to do this is
to wrap the FSM itself in a let. There are a few new things happening here.
First, we're using a TimL atom, so we can swap! the value with the result of
applying a function on it (dec/inc here). Second, this shows off Inputomata's
ability to use the result of a function call as the current state's message.
Note that on valid key presses, the FSM recurs and re-enters; it's the
loop/recur seam that allows the message to be updated without changing states.

    (let [value (atom 0)]
      (fsm {:start
            {:msg #(str "dec/inc value (" @value ") with j/k keys, q to quit")
             \j #(swap! value dec)
             \k #(swap! value inc)
             \q nil}}))
